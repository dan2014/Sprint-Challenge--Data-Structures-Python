Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your ring buffer's `append` method?

    All instructions are O(1) time

2. What is the space complexity of your ring buffer's `append` function?

    No data is added to class instance but data is replaced with values generated when initialized

3. What is the runtime complexity of your ring buffer's `get` method?

    All instructions are O(1) time

4. What is the space complexity of your ring buffer's `get` method?

    Data is sliced from the original array or the entire array is returned. O(n) where n = capacity

5. What is the runtime complexity of the provided code in `names.py`?

    The provided code runs in O(n^2)

6. What is the space complexity of the provided code in `names.py`?

    The space complexity for the provided code is O(n)

7. What is the runtime complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`?

    The runtime complexity of the optimized code is O(n)

8. What is the space complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`?

    The spacetime complexity of the optimized code is O(n^2)
